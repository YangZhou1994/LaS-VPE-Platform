This directory is for storing trained models for machine learning algorithms used in the platform.
 
Since model files are usually very large, adding them to Git may cause difficulty of cloning.
Therefore, it is not recommended to include them in Git.
Instead, please leave a readme in each model directory,
indicating where and how to retrieve the model.
